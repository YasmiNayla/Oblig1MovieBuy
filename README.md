Short description:

The coding has been done consequently every 2 weeks-ish but my main main main (BS) problem has been github and the commits and synching with the repo. Therefore at the very last moment of delivery I recreated new repo, new project (after the recomendation of a TA on the last lab). It really was a battle i tried a lot, but I guess i am bad at researching... coz it was impossible. Not even my friend, that works full time as a developer with JS, whom I sat with last night writing my code better could NOT help me... -,-, 

SO.... github is almost like hell fro me right now xD xD XD specially fro the applied girl syndrome I carry....xD 

WEll!!! found out last minute! WOW...merge them is a must... for some reason i have been afraid of pressing that... in case it all dissapeared like it has happened with a past project I did... xD 
-> At list I learned a lot with my tearfull times with github this time. Soooo happy about that one!!!
